      <p><span>1889</span> - Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London on April 16, 1889. His parents, Charles and Hannah, both music hall artists, separated before he was three years old. Mrs. Chaplin fights to raise Charles and his older half-brother Sydney, illegitimate child, despite his failing health (she ended up being interned in a psychiatric hospital). Living mostly in conditions of extreme poverty, the two boys spent most of their early childhood in institutions for destitute young people.</p>

      <p><span>1899</span> - At the age of ten, however, Charles began his professional career in a troupe of child tap dancers: the Eight Lancashire Lads ("eight guys from Lancashire"). For several years, he played the little groom Billy in the play Sherlock Holmes, even appearing in this role in a theater in the West End, in London. It was during this tour that Chaplin began to make a name for himself and that he rubbed shoulders with great actors who taught him the art of comedy.
      Later, Charlie joined another troupe: the Casey’s Circus, where he shines with his imitations of famous comics.      
      Other jobs in the music hall eventually lead to his recruitment into the troupe of Fred Karno, the largest British manager of cabaret shows. Chaplin's exceptional comedic talents quickly made him the Karno company's star.</p>

      <p><span>1913</span> - In late 1913, during a tour of American music halls, he was noticed by Mack Sennett and hired by the Keystone Comedy Company in Hollywood. It’s the beginning of a long series of short and medium-length films. He then creates the costume and the makeup that will make him famous; in the space of a year, he has taken the path to international fame and affection, like no other comedian has ever known.</p>

      <p>Quickly, he moved from one company to another, with a salary that never ceased to climb, always in search of greater creative autonomy. After the Keystone Company, he joined the Essanay Film Manufacturing Co., then the Mutual Film Compan</p>

      <p><span>1918</span> - He set up his own studio, and in
      <span>1919</span> he was co-founder, with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D. W. Griffith, of United Artists (Associated Artists: an independent distribution house). With masterpieces like L'Émigrant, Charlot soldat, Le Kid or La Ruée vers d'or, Chaplin brings a new dimension to comedy, not only by the extraordinary talents of his acting or his creativity burlesque, but also in the field of character study, emotion and social satire present in his films.</p>

      <p>The advent of the talker was a more difficult problem for Chaplin than for the other silent stars. He had conquered audiences worldwide thanks to the universal language of pantomime. In his first sound films, The City Lights and Modern Times, he actually continues to make silent films, using the new sound medium only to add to the images a synchronized and pre-recorded musical accompaniment.</p>

      <p><span>1940</span> - When he finally launched into dialogues with Le Dictateur, he proved that he could handle sound and speech perfectly. Chaplin experienced an almost unique universal devotion; but in the ambient paranoia of the post-war United States, he is the target of repeated attacks by an American right who suspects him for his radical positions. The FBI, under the direction of its famous boss J. Edgar Hoover, orchestrated against him with much publicity a lawsuit in recognition of paternity which erodes even more its popularity</p>

      <p><span>1947</span> - Chaplin's next film, Monsieur Verdoux, was released in New York in April 1947, when political paranoia reached its first peak. Chaplin, vaguely suspected of extremist sympathies, is one of the most notable victims.
      Already affected by the unfavorable general reaction during the premiere, he is even more affected by a press conference where hostile journalists refuse to talk about the film but insistently ask him questions about his political opinions, his patriotism, his tax problems and his refusal to adopt American national</p>
      <p><span>1952</span> - When Chaplin embarked for London to present his film Spotlight, the American authorities took the opportunity to cancel his return visa. If he returns, he will be arrested, the time for the authorities to verify that he is "admissible under the laws of the United States</p>

      <p>Chaplin then decided to establish permanent residence in Switzerland rather than continuing to fight against the United States. He makes two other films in Europe: A King in New York and The Countess of Hong Kong, publishes two autobiographical books: “My Autobiography” and “My Life in Pictures”, continues to write scripts and compose new musical scores for his old silent films practically until his death, on Christmas night 1977.</p>
